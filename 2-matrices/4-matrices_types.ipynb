    "# 4. Types of Matrices\n",
    "A lot of linear algebra is concerned with operations on vectors and matrices, and there are many diﬀerent types of matrices. There are a few types of matrices that you may encounter again and again when getting started in linear algebra, particularity the parts of linear algebra relevant to machine learning. In this tutorial, you will discover a suite of diﬀerent types of matrices from the field of linear algebra that you may encounter in machine learning. After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",

    "The square matrix is contrasted with the rectangular matrix where the number of rows and columns are not equal. Given that the number of rows and columns match, the dimensions are usually denoted as $n$, e.g. $n×n$. The size of the matrix is called the order, so an order 4 square matrix is 4 ×4. The vector of values along the diagonal of the matrix from the top left to the bottom right is called the main diagonal. Below is an example of an order 3 square matrix.\n",
