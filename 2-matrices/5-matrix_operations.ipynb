The rank is estimated numerically, often using a matrix decomposition method. A common approach is to use the Singular-Value Decomposition or SVD for short. NumPy provides the matrix `rank()` function for calculating the rank of an array. It uses the SVD method to estimate the rank. The example below demonstrates calculating the rank of a matrix with scalar values and another vector with all zero values."
