    "# 5. Matrix Operations\n",
    "Matrix operations are used in the description of many machine learning algorithms. Some operations can be used directly to solve key equations, whereas others provide useful shorthand or foundation in the description and the use of more complex matrix operations. In this tutorial, you will discover important linear algebra matrix operations used in the description of machine learning methods. After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
