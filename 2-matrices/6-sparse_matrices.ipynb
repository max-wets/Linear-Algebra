    "# 6. Sparse Matrices\n",
    "Matrices that contain mostly zero values are called sparse, distinct from matrices where most of the values are non-zero, called dense. Large sparse matrices are common in general and especially in applied machine learning, such as in data that contains counts, data encodings that map categories to counts, and even in whole subfields of machine learning such as natural language processing. It is computationally expensive to represent and work with sparse matrices as though they are dense, and much improvement in performance can be achieved by using representations and operations that specifically handle the matrix sparsity. In this tutorial, you will discover sparse matrices, the issues they present, and how to work with them directly in Python. After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",

An example of a smaller sparse matrix might be a word or term occurrence matrix for words in one book against all known words in English. In both cases, the matrix contained is sparse with many more zero values than data values. The problem with representing these sparse matrices as dense matrices is that memory is required and must be allocated for each 32-bit or even 64-bit zero value in the matrix. This is clearly a waste of memory resources as those zero values do not contain any information."
